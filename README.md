# MNIST Dataset

Build a classifying neural network using TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits in MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.

TensorFlow has the dataset already built in, so there is no need to manually download it.

Build and train the model. Can use any loss function & optimizer.

Plot train and test error over number of epochs.
