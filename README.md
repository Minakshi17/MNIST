# MNIST Dataset
Tensor Flow Challange Poblem
**********************************
Build a classifying neural network using TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits in MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.

TensorFlow has the dataset already built in, so there is no need to manually download it.

Build and train the model. Can use any loss function & optimizer.

Plot train and test error over number of epochs.

Keras Challenge Problem
**************************
Build a CNN using Keras to classify and predict images in Fashion-MNIST (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset.

TensorFlow has the dataset already built in, so there is no need to manually download it. (fashion_mnist)

Build and train the model.

Plot train and test error over number of epochs.
